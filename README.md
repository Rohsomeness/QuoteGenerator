# QuoteGenerator

Project that teaches GPT-2 to generate inspirational quotes. Quotes dataset was taken from other open github repositories and can be found in [quotes.csv] and [quotes2.csv]. These quotes were used to fine-tune the GPT-2 model.

To use the model, simply run all the cells in [Motivational_Quote_Generator.ipynb]. To train the model, set the appropriate TRAIN variable to 1 to allow for training, which will take around 60 minutes with CPU and 6 minutes with GPU. A list of 100 example generated quotes can be found in [generated_quotes.txt].
